The question I've chosen to answer is **Is there a difference in the outcome (i.e. acute ischemic stroke) between the aspirin and high heparin groups?** Right away we can import the data data into pandas and check to see how much data we're working with:"

We also have 112 columns of data, but to answer our question we only need a few, so we'll focus on those instead and use the `IST_variables.csv` file to guide us as to which variables to use. We'll want whatever demographic data we have the subjects including knowing if they were hospitalized due to ischemic stroke, as well as the codings to know which group they were randomized to. Finally, we'll need information on the target outcome, which for simplicity for this analysis we'll consider death at either 14 days or 6 months:\n",

As a factorial study design, patients could be in one of two levels of treatment with aspirin (Yes or No), and simultaneously be in one of three treatment levels for heparin (No, Low, High). That's a total of six possible treatment groups, and to isolate the effect of the treatments in question, we'll reduce our dataset to just two: aspirin with **no** heparin, and high heparin with **no** aspirin, which we'll also denote as Group A and Group B, respectively.\n",
